# intro-rust
Repository to check in and try using rust

Starting from the [W3Schools tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/rust/rust_getstarted.php), I installed rust with:

```rust
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

For an existing directory, I initiated the rust binariess with:

```rust
cargo init
```
